# How should we approach complexity in Learning Analytics?

I have grouped the arguments here lead into roughly 3 categories, in incredibly biased language:
 
* #useless: Reasoning that leads to effectively doing nothing other than acknowledging that things are complex and that this is hard to analyse.
* #wrong: Reasoning that leads to oversimplification of complex systems in order to analyse them, probably leading to misleading results. 
* #relational: A compramise owing to the field of relational biology (Rashevsky, Rosen and Louie) merged with Causal Models (Pearl) and Structured Equaion 


[What should we do?]
  - [Nothing]: Deem the problems too challenging to analyse.
    + <Art over science>: Some things are not worth analysing, there is more 'art' involved than science.
  + [Break it into smaller parts?]:
    + [Yes: Reductionism]: View the system as reducible and analyse the important components. This might need to be split into *autonomous* and *human embedded* systems.
      + <Parsimonious>: The components can be analysed and understood.
        + Allows for a human to be part of the system.
      + <Possible, Simple>: It is possible to analyse the components in a straightfoward manner. #wrong
      - <Might be Wrong>: The sum of the parts may not be the whole in the case of a complex system (this is the very definition by Rosen). #wrong
      - <When is it bad, or good?>:    
    - [No: Irreducible]: View the system as a whole.
       + <Faithful>: This is faithful to the complexity of the original system and fits in with Rosens model. #relational
         +> <Relational Model>
       - <Challenging>: It is difficult to analyse, maybe impossible. #useless
         + <Useless>: If analysis is impossible, then effectively. #useless #wrong  
           +> [Nothing]
  + [Adopt a model]: Adopt some model of complexity and its tools to apply to LA.
    + <Relational Model>: Use a combination of Rosen's entailment model and Pearl's causal models. #relational
      +> <A structural aspect>
      + Provides analytical tools #relational
      + Provides robust definition #relational
      - Requires expertise and development
      - May be challenging to communicate results
  +> [Complexity is abundant in LA]

 ## Defining complexity
 
 [What is complexity?]:
    - <Too hard to define>: #useless
    + <A philosophical aspect>: Can be talked about, but is slippery when it comes to analysis. #useless 
    + <A structural aspect>: Relational biology (See Rosen) has a robust definition in terms of entailment networks (similar to causal models). #relational
    
## Complexity in Learning Analytics

Include examples

[Is complexity an issue in LA?]:
  + [Complexity is abundant in LA] (1) Learning, understanding what people know and how they move from unknowing to knowing. (2)  
    + <Literature>: Davis & Samara, Hagan and Mason all have plenty to say about aspects of complexity in the field of LA.
  - [Complexity can be ignored in LA] 
    + <Results so far>: There have been significant progress so far in LA, often without the complex sciences / systems approach.
