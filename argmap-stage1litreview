# Ben Stage 1 Lit Review Argument

Some abbriviations: 

Causal Models (CM); a graphical causal model framework based on DAGs and Pearls do-calculus tools. 
Causal Inference Frameworks (CIF) are a broader set of frameworks (of which Pearls is one) that attempt to address problems of making causal statements.
Learning Analytics (LA). 

Review should build the follow initial starting points for he PhD, then lead to the three RQs:

#RQ 1 - What does good CM in LA look like?

#RQ 2 - Can diagrammatic reasoning help non-technical experts build causal models?

#RQ 3 - How can CMs help close the loop in an effective way? 

[Causality is of critical importance to LA]
  + <Why is causality is of critical importance to LA?>: LA is concerned with mechanisms for change, intervention and action - not merely describing the learning landscape but changing it. #question 
    + <Making interventions>: Decisions about intervening in a system requires knowledge of what changes what. 
    + <Assessing interventions>: Assessing the effectiveness of an intervention requires the asking of a counterfactual question - what would have been the effect without the intervention? This is a question that must be answered from outside of the data. 
    + <Understanding mechanisms>: Building understanding requires. Capacity to make change and improve.
  - <Data over Theory>: LA should be leveraging the objectivity of data first, not adding more hand-wavyness.
      - <Data are not objective>: Better to add considered and transparent subjectivity, than careless and hidden bias.
      - <Education is different>: There are questions that must be answered outside of the data. 
        +> <Assessing interventions>
  + <How are causal claims being made in LA?>: We know they are of importance, but how? #question
    + <RCT> 
      - <Problems RCTs>: Not always possible of feasible, much of education relies on observational data. Costly. Ethically dubious at times. 
        + <How should they be made?>: #question 
          + <Causal Inference Frameworks (CIF)>: LA and education are not going it alone here, other fields have used CIF to address problems that are common with LA.
            + <CIF in medicine / epi>: Similarities (to find), methods?
            + <CIF in economics>: Similarities (to find), methods?
            + <What are the different CIF approaches?>: #question 
               + <GCM>
                 - <Need experts>: *This probably needs to link to Domain knowledge somewhere - is the same point*
                 + <Intuitive and interpretable>
                   + <GCM good for LA>: #answer: It's main weakness (requiring expertise) helps answer another problem - how to bring experts to the table and bridge the Theory - Data divide?
                     + <RQ1>: #RQ 1: What does good CM in LA look like?
                     //+> <Context experts>
                     //+> [Building epistemic commons]
                     -> <Need experts>
               + <Potential outcomes>
               + <Quasi-experiments>
      

[Inclusivity is of critical importance to LA]
  + <Seats at the table>: Without inclusivity systemic disadvantage continues.
  + <Technical experts>: Need for statistical firepower (complex problems)
    - <Context barrier>: Lack of understanding of local context can lead to mis-interpretation
  + <Context experts>: Local domain knowledge often required to better inform analysis in complex educational systems
    +> <Need experts>
    - <Technical barrier>: Technical requirements can prevent domain experts from taking part. 
      + <How to bring domain knowledge to LA products?>: #question
        + <RQ2>: #RQ 2: Can diagrammatic reasoning help non-technical experts build causal models?
         //+> <GCM good for LA>

[Trust is of critical importance to LA]
  + <Action necessitates trust>: If one wants to *act*, then trust is important.
    -> <Making interventions>
    //-> <Assessing interventions>
    - <Trustyworthy product?>: To act the LA *product* must be *trustworthy* - how do we do this? #question
      + <Transparency>: #answer Also helps inclusivity
        //+> <Seats at the table>
      + <Close the loop>: Bringing the product back to the user, and hopefully showing it works!
        - <Data - Theory divide>: The LA product shouldn't be dismissed out of hand due to it being at complete odds with the stakeholders view.
          + <Building epistemic commons>: #answer Need a middle ground where non-technical and technical can communicate their understanding.
            + <RQ3>: #RQ 3: Can CM help us effectively 'close the loop' in LA?
             // +> <GCM good for LA>
